Sprint 2 saw the development of the game itself. The code written now allows users to choose a game difficulty, choose long (20 questions) or a short (10 questions) game and play the game that asks random multiplication questions (based on difficulty). Data from the user's interaction and answers is stored. The data collected includes:

    The number of games played in each difficulty level 
    Number of questions answered correctly in each game 
    The number of incorrect answers for each multiplied number (e.g., if the answer for 5 * 3 is incorrect then adds one to both 3 and 5 keys in dictionary storing how many times each number was incorrectly answered) 
    The total time it took to complete a game 
    The time it takes to answer each question 
    The number of points scored by the user 


One display component (question arrangement), and two menu components (play game and choose game length menu) were trialed. The feedback from the testers were analysed and the best trialed options were chosen and implemented in the program. All the components added to the program in this sprint include:

    Play game menu 
    Menu asking the user for length of game they want to play in each difficulty level 
    Page asking user multiplication questions unique to each difficulty level 
    Menu asking the user if they want to play again or head back to main menu in each difficulty level 


At this stage the program is completely functional and fit for purpose. After the fixation of errors, testing ensures that the program is functional and works without crashing.
