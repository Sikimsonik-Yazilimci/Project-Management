Sprint 1 was focused on developing the base of the program. That includes the main menu, the game description page, and the game rewards page.

Certain components of the menu and game description page were trialed. The feedback from the testers were analysed, and the best options (out of those trialed) were chosen and implemented in the program.
Because different pages have similar structures (e.g. game description page and list of rewards page are similar in structure), the chosen options were also integrated into other pages of the interface.

The program was tested thoroughly to ensure that it is robust.
